Divvy is a popular bike rental service that started in Chicago in 2013. Both customers and subscribers alike can rent bikes at any of the city&rsquo;s hundreds of locations for up to 30 minutes. Like many other open data projects, Divvy has made it&rsquo;s data public for understanding how people explore the city on bike.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>When you open the application, you are greeted by a screen showing the city of Chicago, and all of the Divvy stations. At first glance you can see where the most popular stations are in the city, with the dark blue stations marking the ten most popular stations in the city, with the highest number of trips in and out of all.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>When we click on any of the pins on the map, we are greeted with a popup that shows you information about the station, like the name of the intersection where it&rsquo;s located and the number of bikes that have come into and out of that station.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 411.00px; height: 339.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" style="width: 411.00px; height: 339.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Clicking on either in or out in the pin will render paths on the screen of all the trips that terminated at or originated from that station respectively. Note that the thickness of any path is a proxy for the number of trips that went down that direction. So, thicker paths represent more trips than thinner paths. (Note: The inflow to a station is marked by a downward Divvy arrow while outflow is marked by black arrows).</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 444.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 444.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We can always return back to the original map of Divvy pins by clicking on the reset icon in the bottom right corner.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>On the right-hand side of the interface we have access to a couple different areas in the sidebar. By clicking the top icon of a graph, we have access to different representations that depict information about the data set. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>By clicking on the different tabs within each section we can change between different types of graphs. For example, in the top we&#39;re existing graphics the first tab gives us information, The second tab gives information about subscriber status, and the third tab gives information about age.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Below demographics we can find descriptive statistics about Chicago&rsquo;s Divvy stations. In each pane of the interface, Chicago aggregate data is shown to the left while the same statistics for set of selected stations or community areas are shown to the right. Plots can be generated for Distribution of Bikes by Day of the Week, Distribution of Bikes out by Hour of Day, Distribution of Bikes by Distance Travelled, Distribution of Ride Duration, Distribution of Distance for Individual Bikes, and Number of Bikes out per day of the year.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Selecting multiple stations can be done by double clicking individual stations or selecting entire community areas. To view the community areas, simply click to enable the layer from the Leaflet layers pane.

We had to make the decision early in the process of how we wanted to organize the trips across the entire corpus. The motivating reason for this choice was that distances travelled are frequently idiosyncratic, so the distance of any one trip does not serve as a useful nominal variable. This is in contrast to the day of week and hour of day distributions, where &ldquo;Thursday&rdquo; or &ldquo;8 am&rdquo; make useful categories to tally frequency of rides.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In order to approach this problem, we went across the entire data set and collected all of the ride distances in meters. We made the decision, though, that meters were not as comprehensible a unit as kilometers. We assert that (1) people are more familiar with kilometers because they have an intuitive sense of the distance from driving and (2) many athletic individuals, a characteristic that applies to many Divvy users, have participated in 5k runs.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Using Excel, the spread of all Divvy trips was imported into a pivot table and turned into a plot.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 448.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 448.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We had to then make a decision about how to bound the ranges of distance so that we could bin each ride into a category. To maintain fidelity to the distribution of the data, we divided the data up into 0.5 km ranges (e.g., 0-0.5 km, 0.5-1.0 km, etc.). The choice of 0.5 was again because humans have a good intuitive sense of what half of something is, and so half of a kilometer made a reasonable division.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In addition to deciding on the step size of each frequency range, we also had to make a decision about setting a maximum threshold to display on the plot. Many of the trips in the data corpus (well over 95%) fell beneath the 10km mark. Given that Divvy limits all trips to 30 minutes or less and an average biker would attain 13 km/h (~8 mph), we would have expected many of the trips to fall beneath 6.5 km. The dataset surprised us in this regard, but it is consistent with many users renting the bikes for longer than the allotted 30 minutes. We extended the upper range of the dataset to 10 km to give information in the region between our upper expectation (6.5 km) and a point where the data began tapering off.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These data were then transformed into a JSON data structure:</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 437.00px; height: 274.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 437.00px; height: 274.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.4zjocsk30xxq"></a><span class="c15">Distribution of Rides by Day of Year</span></h2><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To generate a distribution of rides by the day of the year, we had to use the date record for each entry of the database to group trips in a pivot table.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 368.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 368.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Trips coincident on the same day were then grouped together and produced a frequency.

We assert that double counting a ride would artificially inflate the distribution for trips that crossed the boundary.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Again, these data were then transformed into a JSON data structure for D3 development:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 437.00px; height: 266.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" style="width: 437.00px; height: 266.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h3 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.gf9i47q95ouo"></a><span>Distribution of Rides by Duration</span></h3><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Divvy places a limit on all bike trips of 30 minutes. Trips extending beyond this limit are subject to surcharges beyond normal rental fees. When approaching the trip duration within the data set, we anticipated that the presence of late fees would incline individuals to return their bike within the time range. As such, we expected that we would find a normal distribution of rides with a mean trip duration somewhere below 30 mintes. What we found was actually very surprising and required us to conceptualize how the data needed to be presented.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Each trip in the database has a record that captures the duration of each trip down to the nearest second. To be consistent with Divvy&rsquo;s design, we first transformed each of these times into minutes. Then using a pivot table, we went about creating a distribution of the trip duration. Again, the same problem that we had to address in the creation of the bike distance distribution came up again with the trip duration distribution. The length of any one rider&rsquo;s trip is idiosyncratic and does not provide a useful categorical variable for characterizing the data set.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We were then presented with the decision of grouping trips by some meaningful time range. We decided that grouping trips by 5 minute intervals (e.g., 0-5 min, 5-10 min, etc.) was a useful choice for a few reasons. First, 5 minutes is an easily conceptualized length of time because it is a common division of time on the clock. Second, at a leisurely pace (~7&ndash;8 mph) the average rider will travel 1 km in 5 minutes, leaving this choice consistent with the distance divisions for the distance distribution chart.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then using Excel, we created a pivot table to produce a frequency distribution of rides in 5 minutes chunks:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 458.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 458.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These data were then transformed into a JSON file for D3 development.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 473.00px; height: 285.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image06.png" style="width: 473.00px; height: 285.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h3 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.t1v5mskac0pf"></a><span>Distribution of Distances Travelled for Each Bike</span></h3><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Of the plots we were asked to create, this one became the most challenging to conceptualize and design. A major challenge that we had to tackle from the beginning, was the fact that there are over three thousand unique bikes in the Divvy system. The nature of any representation that displays data on a per bike basis, was going to be large from the outset. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To create this plot we had to make a few really important decisions. The first decision was what type of representation could reproduce a distribution (something that to this point we had done with large histograms), but allow for the co-presentation of more than three thousand individual distributions in the same display. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We decided that the best option here would be a stacked bar chart. A stacked bar is a single bar representation broken into segments, where each segment represents ranges of a distribution relevant to a single nominal variable. A common example of this type of plot is demographic breakdown charts for multiple countries. Each country (the nominal variable) is broken down into some ethnic categories to show the spread of ethnicities comprising the total population. Each category is allocated some proportion of the total length of each bar and the sum of the parts equals the whole. In the Divvy distance distributions, this would mean that each bar represents the total trips taken by any bike in the collection. This bar is broken into distance divisions, where the number of trips fitting in each distance range is reflected by the proportion of the bar&rsquo;s length the range assumes.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Stacked bar charts come in two prominent flavors. The first is the normalized stacked bar chart. A normalized stacked bar chart uses a hundred percent as the scaling factor to which all nominal variables are fitted. For example, no matter how many times a bike is ridden, the number of trips are scaled to a hundred percent, so that it is only possible to determine what percentage of rides occured in any range. By design, this particular representation is unable to show that certain bikes are used more often than others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>An alternative to the normalized bar chart is the non-normalized stacked bar chart. In this representation it is still possible to ascertain the relative proportion of each trip with regards to the whole distribution, but it provides a qualitative sense of the relative imbalance between the usage of bikes across the data sample. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We felt that the non-normalized bar chart would be a better choice to display the data from the Divvy dataset, precisely because it allowed us to show the asymmetric use of certain bikes, while also retaining fidelity to the relative proportion of rides that fell within certain ranges of distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>To design this representation, we felt the best choice would be to remain consistent with the distance distribution chart. Thus, we used the same distance binnings (i.e., per 0.5 km) to characterize the trips per bike.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The data were collected on a per bike basis much in the same way as the total distance distribution, except the pivot table was more expansive to characterize each bike individually.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 264.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image08.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 264.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once we had decided on a representation design, we had to make a few more decisions about the presentation of the data and what would be relevant to the user. First, we decided that the bike ID number which was so useful to us in organizing the data, was a useless variable for the consumer of this application. Second, since we chose to use the non-normalized bar chart in our design, we decided it would be most meaningful to arrange the trips in order by the total number of trips taken per bike. This would produce a resultant representation that had a smooth gradation from most used to least used bike. Had we not made this choice to order the trips, the graph would have been a complete jumble and likely afforded the user little insight into the data.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These data were then transformed two times into different formats for representation in D3.

We resolved these issue by first querying all the rides for the busiest day of the year and calculating an imbalance coefficient.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><h2 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.jzagu3dbbvj1"></a><span>Imbalance ratio</span></h2><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The imbalance ratio was calculated by dividing the number of rides into a station and the number of rides from a station in a way that produced a quotient either =0 or &ge;1. The method of calculation is as follows:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_2bfnp3vnjcet-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c5"><span>If rides into AND rides from == 0, then the ratio is 0</span></li><li class="c0 c5"><span>If rides into OR rides from == 0, then the ratio is the non-zero value</span></li><li class="c0 c5"><span>If rides into AND rides from !=0, then:</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_2bfnp3vnjcet-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c11"><span>if rides into &gt; rides from, then the ratio would be rides into / rides from</span></li><li class="c0 c11"><span>if rides from &gt; rides into, then the ratio would be rides from / rides into</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These values were then collected for the busiest day of the Divvy and produced a distribution of quotients that were grouped using a pivot table by 0.1. The resultant distribution was found to lose its decreasing quality beyond 1.7, at which point the plot behaved erratically. We chose this cutoff value as the point beyond which we would classify a station as imbalanced.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><h2 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.323wecuvsur6"></a><span>Time Frame</span></h2><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once we had an imbalance coefficient, we then had to decide how we wanted to define a station as imbalanced. Was this an instantaneous metric? Was this a metric that accrued over the history of the station? Was this a feature that could be determined differently at different times of the day?</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We decided that we needed to blend two of these ideas to make sense of the imbalance of the stations. Specifically, we merged the ideas of imbalance being a property of the time of day </span><span class="c14">as evidenced</span><span>&nbsp;across historical time.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><h2 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.nxv8073yvpcx"></a><span>Identifying Historically Imbalanced Stations</span></h2><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To identify the historically imbalanced stations we divided up the data set into time ranges for morning (6 &ndash; 9 am), lunch (11 am &ndash; 1pm), after work (4 pm &ndash; 7 pm), and evening (7 &ndash; 9 pm). Within each of these time ranges, we calculated the imbalance ratios for each individual station across the entire data corpus.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 218.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 218.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then if a station had a ratio &ge;1.7 for half or more of the days in the record, it was tagged as historically imbalanced during that time period.

Some stations were roughly equidistant from the center of east campus. So to get the most information about where Divvy users were coming from/going to, we discriminated between equidistant stations based on their popularity (i.e., the &ldquo;bluer&rdquo; stations being more popular). </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The location of these stations is presented below in this geographic snapshot of UIC&rsquo;s east campus.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 464.00px;"><img alt="stations.jpg" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 464.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For reference, the stations that we chose were:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_ls8eydiwlmtt-0 start"><li class="c0 c5"><span>900 W.

The paths between these locations is then drawn to varying thicknesses, where the thickness of any line is a proxy for it&rsquo;s relative popularity (i.e., the thicker the line, the more trips that occurred along that path).</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As can be seen in the accompanying visualization, many outgoing trips originating from UIC head towards Divvy check-in stations in the Loop, near Olgilvie Transportation Center and Union Station. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 380.50px;"><img alt="out2.jpg" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 380.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Interestingly, this pattern was not observed universally on outbound and inbound Divvy stations.
